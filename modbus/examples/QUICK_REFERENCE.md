# Modbus Monitor - Quick Reference

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Summary

Your `modbus_monitor.py` had a **critical bug** that broke 32-bit register readings.

### The Bug
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
read_holding_registers(address, count=1)  # Always reads 1 register

# FIXED:
read_holding_registers(address, count=dynamic)  # Reads 1 or 2 based on data_type
```

### Impact
- ‚ùå Energy meters (uint32): Wrong values
- ‚ùå Power meters (int32): Wrong values
- ‚úÖ Basic 16-bit readings: Worked fine

## üöÄ Deploy in 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Copy fixed script to BeagleBone
scp modbus/examples/modbus_monitor_fixed.py debian@beaglebone:/opt/modbus_monitor/modbus_monitor.py

# 2. Regenerate config (fixed slave IDs already done)
curl -X POST http://YOUR_SERVER:8000/api/modbus/devices/apply_all_configurations/

# 3. Restart monitor
pm2 restart modbus_monitor
```

## üîç Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check logs (should show successful reads)
pm2 logs modbus_monitor --lines 20
